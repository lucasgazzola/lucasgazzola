## 💻 About Me

I'm a self-taught frontend developer and a student of Information Systems Engineering.  
I love building modern and responsive user interfaces with **React**, and I'm currently diving deeper into **Next.js** and backend technologies like **Node.js** and **MongoDB** to become a fullstack developer.  

Coding is one of my biggest passions — I enjoy solving problems, learning new things every day, and turning ideas into code.  
My goal is to get my first job in tech and grow as a developer in the process 🚀
